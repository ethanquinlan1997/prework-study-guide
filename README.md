## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

This Prework Study Guide was created in the efforts to help boot camp students through Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. As a boot camp student myself, I understand the challenges and overwhelmingness that comes with the complexity of web development. I enjoy facing new challenges and solving all annoying bugs that come with it. This website will give you a backbone to the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
